# Stats Squared


Built for quickly creating D&D characters using the stats squared method, described below.

Each stat costs its value squared. Thus a 3 costs 9 points, a 10 costs 100 points, and an 18 costs 324 points. A total, such as 1100 points is given to start creation. I enjoyed to minimizing wasted points while still creating a viable character.

This script was found while I was rumaging through my old files. Putting it on github for backup.
