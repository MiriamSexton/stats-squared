# Stats Squared
An old-school javascript tool by Miriam Sexton

Built for quickly creating D&D characters using the stats squared method, described below.

Each stat costs its value squared. Thus a 3 costs 9 points, a 10 costs 100 points, and an 18 costs 324 points. A total, such as 1100 points, is given at the start of creation. I enjoyed minimizing wasted points while still creating a viable character, so I needed a tool to help. I believe this method was created by Walter Destler.

This script was found while I was rumaging through my old files. I thought it was a neat reminder of how I wrote in pure javascript, before jQuery. Putting it on github for backup.
